# Embedded Engineering Roadmap

This is a roadmap for those who want to build a career as an Embedded Developer or Embedded Engineer.
In order to assist beginners, steps have been taken to create a roadmap that is straightforward and easy to understand.

If you think that this map can be improved in anyway, please start an issue or pull request, Iâ€™ll be maintaining and updating this repository frequently. The source file can be edited using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/download/) 

**A special thanks to my friends in the Iranian Twitter community (Electronics and Embedded Systems Engineers) for their help in updating this roadmap.**
